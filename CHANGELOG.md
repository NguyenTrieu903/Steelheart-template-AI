- **Comprehensive Summary**: Combined review and comment results in single report

### üîß **Usage Examples**

```bash
# Auto-review with auto-commenting (default)
steelheart auto-review

# Auto-review without auto-commenting
steelheart auto-review --no-comment

# Auto-review with custom base branch
steelheart auto-review --base develop

# Include uncommitted changes
