              Analyze the Git diff between this branch and master, and identify all JavaScript source files with added or changed exports (functions, classes, methods).

              For each identified change, generate appropriate Jest test cases:

                - If a test file (e.g., *.test.js or *.spec.js) already exists, append the new tests to it.

                - If no test file exists, create a new test file in the same folder or a __tests__/ or tests/ directory, consistent with the projectâ€™s structure.

              Follow the project's existing testing style, use realistic test inputs, and focus on code coverage and edge cases.

              Ensure the generated tests are:

                - Syntactically correct and runnable

                - Focused only on new or changed logic

                - Written in Jest, using describe, test or it, and expect assertions.

              Do not generate tests for unchanged or deleted code.`;
